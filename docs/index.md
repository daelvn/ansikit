# ansikit - ANSI code toolkit for Lua

A library for usual ANSI codes, with some extended capabilities like a color palette library or styling functions. It is written in MoonScript but plays nice with Lua.

## Installation

You can install the library with [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/).

```
$ luarocks install ansikit
```

This will make all modules available to you.

LuaRocks should automatically install dependencies for the module, but otherwise, feel free to manually download [typical](https://github.com/hoelzro/lua-typical) and [guardia](https://github.com/daelvn/guardia).

```
$ luarocks install typical
$ luarocks install guardia
```
