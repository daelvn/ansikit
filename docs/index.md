# ansikit - ANSI code toolkit for Lua

A library for usual ANSI codes, with some extended capabilities like a color palette library or styling functions. It is written in MoonScript but plays nice with Lua.

## Installation

```
$ luarocks install ansikit
```

## License

I'm throwing this, as always, to the public domain, do what you want with it.
